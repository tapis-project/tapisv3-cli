There are two tenants within TAPIS: tacc and dev
There are three environments: develop, staging, and prod

The appropriate environment should be substituted below based on the progress
of development for a feature or for testing purposes. For example:
    * tacc.develop.tapis.io = TACC tenant in development environment
    * dev.staging.tapis.io = DEV tenant in the staging environment

NOTE: The TACC tenant in production is tacc.tapis.io, not tacc.prod.tapis.io!
